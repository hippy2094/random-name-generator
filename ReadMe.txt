Random name list generator
(c)2017 Matthew Hipkin <http://www.matthewhipkin.co.uk>


Creates an XML file containing a list of random names and ages up to the value
specified in TOTALCOUNT (line 10).

Requires fpc <http://www.frepascal.org> to build and for both firstnames.txt 
and surnames.txt to be in the same directory.

The name parts were taken from http://homepage.net/name_generator/
